# Astradal War Rules

The official rules of warfare on Astradal. This system is designed to provide a structured, fair, and engaging experience for geopolitical conflicts. All wars are admin-scheduled events to ensure fairness and prevent offline raiding.

## The War Process: A Quick Overview
1.  **Declaration:** A nation or town makes a formal declaration of war in Discord.
2.  **Admin Review & Scheduling:** Server staff review the declaration for validity and schedule the war for the upcoming weekend in coordination with both parties.
3.  **Preparation Period:** A "phony war" period where both sides gather resources and prepare their defenses without engaging in combat.
4.  **The War Event:** The scheduled battle takes place, supervised by an admin.
5.  **Resolution:** An admin declares a victor, enforces the war goal, and implements a mandatory truce period.

## Phase 1: Declaration of War

All wars must be formally declared in the `#nation-announcements` channel on Discord by the official leader of the attacking town or nation.

#### **Declaration Format:**

* **War Type:** Choose one of the official types listed below.
* **Casus Belli:** The justified, in-character reason for the war.
* **War Goal:** The specific, tangible outcome you wish to achieve, which must be logically linked to your Casus Belli. (e.g., Casus Belli: `Lost Province`, War Goal: `Cede the town of Silvercreek to our nation.`)
* **Belligerents:** Clearly list the attacking and defending towns/nations.

#### **Staff Review & Response Period:**

Once a declaration is posted, it will be reviewed by server staff. Staff will ensure the Casus Belli is valid, the war goal is reasonable, and the declaration is made in good faith.

The defending party has **24 hours** to publicly respond to the declaration. They may accept the war, or attempt to negotiate a peaceful resolution (which the attacker is not required to accept). If no response is given, the war is considered accepted.

## Phase 2: Scheduling & Preparation

#### **Scheduling:**
All wars are admin-scheduled events. Once a war is declared and accepted, a staff member will create a private thread with the leaders of both sides to coordinate a specific time for the battle.
* Wars will be scheduled for the **following weekend** (Friday, Saturday, or Sunday).
* The chosen time must be mutually agreed upon. If an agreement cannot be reached, an admin will select a time deemed fairest for the majority of players on both sides.

#### **The Preparation Period (The "Phony War"):**
The time between the war declaration and the scheduled event is the Preparation Period. During this time:
* All PvP between the belligerents is **forbidden**.
* Spying is permitted, but sabotage or griefing of any kind is not.
* Both sides are expected to gather resources, craft gear, and prepare their defenses or assault strategies.

## Phase 3: The War Event & Rules of Engagement

The war event will be initiated and supervised by a server admin. The admin will define the "warzone" (typically the defending town's claimed land) and announce the start and end of the battle.

#### **General Rules of Engagement:**
1.  **Sportsmanship:** All participants are expected to demonstrate good sportsmanship. Trash talk is fine, but personal insults, harassment, or toxicity will result in removal from the event and further punishment.
2.  **No Joining Mid-Battle:** Once the war has officially begun, no new players may join either side.
3.  **Admin is Final:** All admin decisions during the event are final. Arguing with the supervising admin may result in your disqualification.

#### **Gear & Item Restrictions:**
To ensure balanced and fair combat, the following item restrictions apply to all participants inside the warzone:

* **Prohibited Equipment:**
    * Elytra
    * Totems of Undying
* **Prohibited Consumables:**
    * Tipped Arrows (of any kind)
* **Prohibited Enchantments:**
    * Any item with extremely high, non-vanilla enchantments (e.g., a "Knockback X Stick").
* **Restricted Items:**
    * **Mace:** A maximum of **one (1)** mace user is allowed for every five (5) members of a team. (1-5 players = 1 mace, 6-10 players = 2 maces, etc.). The mace may not have enchantments greater than **Density 3** or **Breach 3**.
    * **Enchanted Golden Apples:** A maximum of **sixteen (16)** per player. You may not carry more than 16 in your inventory at any time. Regular Golden Apples are not restricted.
    * **Experience Bottles:** A maximum of **three (3) stacks** per player, for the purpose of mending gear.

#### **Tactics & Fortification Rules:**
1.  **Movement:** Using Ender Pearls or Wind Charges for general battlefield mobility is **allowed**. Using them to bypass or scale primary defensive walls is **forbidden**. Flying machines are not to be used for assault.
2.  **Siege Access:** The defending town's primary fortifications **must** have at least one intended point of entry (e.g., a gate). This point can be heavily defended but cannot be permanently blocked by an unavoidable trap or lava wall. The goal is to encourage sieges, not impossible stalemates.
3.  **Traps:** Traps are permitted, but they must be reasonably avoidable and cannot utilize exploits, glitches, or server lag to function. Inescapable pits or traps designed to hold a player indefinitely are not allowed. All lava-based traps must be clearly visible.
4.  **No "Grief" Breaking:** Blocks may only be broken for strategic purposes (e.g., creating a breach in a wall, disabling a farm for the duration of the battle). Wanton, large-scale destruction of non-military structures is forbidden. All damage will be rolled back by staff after the war.

## Phase 4: Victory & Resolution

#### **Victory Conditions:**
The victor is decided based on the **War Type** selected during the declaration. This is typically handled automatically by the Towny Event War system (e.g., controlling a flag, knocking out all enemy towns). An admin will make the final, official declaration of victory.

#### **Enforcement of Goals:**
Following the war, a staff member will enforce the victor's stated War Goal. This may include:
* Transferring ownership of Towny plots or entire towns.
* Facilitating the payment of resources or currency.
* Officially renaming an item or title.
* Forcing the loser to make a public declaration (e.g., for a `Humiliate` goal).

#### **Truce Period:**
After the conclusion of a war, a mandatory **two-week (14 day)** truce is enacted between the primary belligerents. During this time, neither side may declare war on the other.
